# C++ Sudoku Solver!

With this project I'm experimenting with C++ and trying to see if I can write a program with it that can solve any Sudoku puzzle. 

This sofware lets one write a valid Sudoku puzzle and then it solves that puzzle for the user quickly because C++ is a compiled language meaning that it runs much faster than an interpreted language such as Python.

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project include Visual Studio 2019 and Cmake.
I used C++ to write this software along with some C libraries including cstudio, cstring, and cstdlb.
