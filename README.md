# C++ Sudoku Solver!

With this project I'm experimenting with C++ and trying to see if I can write a program with it that can solve any Sudoku puzzle. 

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}
This sofware lets one write a valid Sudoku puzzle and then it solves that puzzle for the user quickly because C++ is a compiled language meaning that it runs much faster than an interpreted language such as Python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project include Visual Studio 2019 and Cmake.
I used C++ to write this software along with some C libraries including cstudio, cstring, and cstdlb.
